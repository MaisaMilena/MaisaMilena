### Greetings üññ

I'm Maisa, and I'm a software developer most interested in:
- Mobile App Development
- System design
- Simple solutions
- Clean code
- User experience
- Software developer's experience
- Tech startups

I have a major degree in Information Systems (Universidade Cat√≥lica de Bras√≠lia) and a specialization in iOS Development (Apple Developer Academy - Bras√≠lia). Some things I've worked on involve mobile and web applications, games, features for programming languages, building scripts to automate tasks, and technical documentation.

Part of my experiences involve:
- Swift: iOS (UIKit, SwiftUI, ViewCode, Viper, MVVM, Core Data, in-app purchase)
- Dart: Flutter (Bloc architecture)
- Accessibility features and user experience
- Web3 (blockchain, NFTs, Ethereum)
- Agile methodologies
- Proof of Concepts (PoC) and building Minimum Viable Products (MVP)
  
I have experience working in small (<10 people) and big startups (+1000 people). Mostly working on product-driven and multidisciplinary teams.
